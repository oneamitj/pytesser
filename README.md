Introduction:
============
PyTesser is an Optical Character Recognition module for Python. It takes 
as input an image or image file and outputs a string.

PyTesser uses the Tesseract OCR engine (an Open Source project at Google), 
converting images to an accepted format and calling the Tesseract 
executable as an external script. A Windows executable is provided 
along with the Python scripts. The scripts should work in Linux as well.

Dependencies:
=============
- PIL is required to work with images in memory.
  > https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/
- This version of PyTesser has been tested with Python 3.4 in Windows 10 and Python 2.7 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- For Linux:
	+ Add executable permission to all .exe file `chmod +x dlltest.exe tesseract.exe`
	+ Install wine `sudo apt-get install wine`
	+ Execute `winetricks  mfc42`


Installation:
==============
No installation. Just download - import - use.

Usage:
================================

	>>> from pytesser import *
	>>> img = Image.open("my_image_path")
	>>> text = image_to_string(img)
	>>> print text

	>>> try:
	... 	text = image_file_to_string("my_tif_image", graceful_errors=False)
	... except errors.Tesser_General_Exception, value:
	... 	print("`tif_image` is incompatible filetype.  Try graceful_errors=True")
	... 	print(value)
	... 	

`tif image file` is incompatible filetype.  Try graceful_errors=True
